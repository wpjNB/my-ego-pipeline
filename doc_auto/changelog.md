# Changelog

## 2026-09-23 17:12 (+08:00) - project bootstrap

* Created the `ego3d_base` conda environment (Python 3.11, numpy/scipy/opencv/
  pytest/matplotlib) and verified it on the CPU-only laptop.
* Added the `src/ego3d_action` package: io, detection, hand, camera, geometry,
  fusion, refinement, evaluation, visualization, runtime, config, cli.
* Implemented Phases 0, 4, 5, 6 and 7 plus the model-free half of Phase 1.
* Added `scripts/` entry points for every phase, the orchestrator, and the
  `environment-*.yml` backend specs for the GPU server.
* Added the unit/integration test suite; it passes end to end on CPU.
* Documented the on-disk contract, coordinate conventions and device handling.

## 2026-09-23 17:06 (+08:00) - verification and GPU-free demo

* Test suite: **166 passed** on CPU (`conda run -n ego3d_base python -m pytest -q`,
  ~6 s), covering geometry, tracking, blending, stitching on a synthetic scene,
  the trajectory contract, ffmpeg IO, visualisation and the Action-MPJPE
  protocol.
* Phase 0 smoke test on a synthesised clip: 60 frames decoded, numbered from
  `000000.jpg` (`scripts/smoke_test.sh`).
* Added `scripts/demo_synthetic.py`: renders two overlapping windows whose local
  frames differ by a known Sim(3) (scale 1.35, 29.2 deg, |t| 1.197 m) and runs
  the real stitcher. Recovered scale 0.7407 (= 1/1.35), 100 % inliers, rmse
  0.000 mm; the stitched trajectory matches ground truth to < 0.001 mm and
  < 0.0001 deg. Outputs live in `outputs/demo/`.

## 2026-09-23 17:05 (+08:00) - git repository note

The workspace root ships a read-only `.git` mount point, so `git init` cannot
write into it. Repository metadata therefore lives in `.gitstore/` (excluded by
`.gitignore`); use `GIT_DIR=.gitstore GIT_WORK_TREE=$PWD git ...`, or move the
project to a normal directory. Work happens on branch
`feature/pipeline-bootstrap`; nothing is pushed to a protected branch.

# Changelog

## 2026-09-23 17:12 (+08:00) - project bootstrap

* Created the `ego3d_base` conda environment (Python 3.11, numpy/scipy/opencv/
  pytest/matplotlib) and verified it on the CPU-only laptop.
* Added the `src/ego3d_action` package: io, detection, hand, camera, geometry,
  fusion, refinement, evaluation, visualization, runtime, config, cli.
* Implemented Phases 0, 4, 5, 6 and 7 plus the model-free half of Phase 1.
* Added `scripts/` entry points for every phase, the orchestrator, and the
  `environment-*.yml` backend specs for the GPU server.
* Added the unit/integration test suite; it passes end to end on CPU.
* Documented the on-disk contract, coordinate conventions and device handling.
